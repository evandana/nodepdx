#Outline

example

    getUser('kim')
        .then( user => // ... user exists! )
        .catch( err => // ... user doesn't exist )

promise.catch will "catch" user not exists, but also syntax errors 

#NodeOS

* people trashed it

#NodeJS

#Cultural influences
* Twitter fame
* Digital legacy
* if you aren't selling it, it's a liability not an asset
* push for companies to open source stuff

#Learnings
* "car" effect (humanize people, meet in person is different from online)
* learn the personalities to better interpret their words
* give space to quiet voices
* hear everyone so they can listen (if people feel heard, then they can move on past their own needs)
* take time to define your own words
* share the risk of new ideas (facilitator should share the risk of the new ideas)
 - a few examples of how to share the risk of new ideas?

##take time to define your own words
* echo back and paraphrase
* have someone else echo back
* ask edge questions (if trusted)

# Conclusions
* how might my public comment be perceived
* be tacticle with others
* take time to hear *honest* people
