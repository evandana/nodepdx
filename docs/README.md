#How do you find info?

#Looking at Twilio docs and how new devs use it
* measure
    * time on page
    * bounce rate
* top results
    * api
    * quickstarts
    * how-tos

we learn through stories (english or code)
* *tl;dr* but coders don't have time to read stories

compared to sentences before code samples
* traffic was great if < 4 lines
* traffic was terrible if > 11
* this even affected the section performance, beyond the page

###Attempted to solve though example app
* Created heroku-buildable app
* Took a long time to build it
* Users were clueless as to how to start
    * wasn't very user friendly

###Example app V2
* step-through-guide
* better metrics
* good, but...
    * the icons and sections didn't make sense
    * file explorer doesn't look like their own stuff
    * said it worked, but observation showed it didn't work great

###V3
* metrics
    * Double the session length
    * triple the page/session
* *first code example needs to be simple (<10 lines)*
* added metrics and tracking to learn what they need
    * allows for better prioritization
    * a great section could then provide insights for weaker sections

###Their next steps
* "viewsaurus" tool which generates code doc template file
