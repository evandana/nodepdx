#getting the distance sensor working

my particle app is called 'distance-ping'

so, with [this tutorial](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/examples/photon/#intro-3), i was able to [log](https://dashboard.particle.io/user/logs) to the web whether or not the photo-sensor was receiving light. cool!
